				<h3>Chvrches<br>Summerstage</h3>
					<p>This indie synth pop band knows how to put on a show! This was easily one of the best shows I ever been too! The energy from the ground, the choreography from the band, the stage lights, and the outdoors atmosphere made this show feel like I was on cloud 9. The best part was when they performed a song about a storm "Cleares Blue" the rain started to come down (talk about perfect timing!), and everyone in the crowd raised their arms up to the sky and started jumping. I still have goosebumps thinking about it! I recommend everyone to check them out when they are in your town</P>

				<h3>Global Citizen<br>Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Beyonce, Pearl Jam</h3>
					<p>Not only is this a free and great music festival for music fans, but it's actually for a great cause as well! To get tickets one most donate or volunteer their time to help solve a world problem (whether it's famine, women's right, race equality, etc.). This show was amazing! Seeing so many superstars take the stage and put on a great show. My favorite performer was Ed Sheeran. It amazes me how he can put such an amazing show with just a guitar and his vocals. I suggest everyone to do something better for their community and check out the festival next year!</p>

				<h3>Walk The Moon<br>Terminal 5</h3>
					<p>I must say this has been one of the best shows I ever been too! Let me start by saying how much I dislike Terminal 5! The sound is shitty, you can't really see the acts unless you're on the rails or close in the ground floor, and for some reason it's always humid, but this isn't a review about the venue. Back to Walk The Moon. The band was incredible! The energy never stopped, and you just get chills when you see the crowd singing along to every single word, from every single song. The colors and the bands energy is unmatched. There wasn't a single soul that was bored that night.</p>

				<h3>Tinashe<br>"Player"</h3>
					<p>One of the hottest releases of the Fall. Tinashe first single from her upcoming sophomore album hits the heart. With an uptempo beat, and a bass that will make your body shake, this song was meant to smash at parties and the airwaves. The lyrics singals Tinashe growth as an artist, and her vocals soar in the chorus!</P>

					<p>I rate this song a 4/5</p>

				<h3>Sia<br>"Alive"</h3>
					<p>Easily the BEST vocals of 2015! Originally this song was meant for <i>Adele's</i> new album, but thankfully Sia kept the song. Adele is one of the best singers, but the lyrics and emotion of this song really makes it a Sia classic. This song is about overcoming struggles, and people who put you down. Sia is known for having such a trouble pass (as she mentions in the line "I was born in a thunderstorm..."), and this song feels like her anthem in telling her haters she survived, and is now thriving! This is easily the best vocals of 2015, and the last minute and a half will leave you with goosebumps for days!</p>

					<p>I rate this song a 5/5</p>

					<h3>Pentatonix<br>"Can't Sleep Love"</h3>
						<p>The first single from their upcoming album, this accapella group is really unique. What you hear is pure vocals, and no instruments involved. It's incredible what they can do with just their vocal chords! It has a very <i>Justin Timberlake</i> feeling to it. This is a strong debut for this pop group that is an internet sensation.</p>

						<p>I rate this song a 4/5</p>
